PII or Personally identifiable information (PII) is any data that could potentially identify a specific individual, e.g. to distinguish one person from another. Below are a few examples of PII:

- Name
- Address
- Date of birth
- Telephone number
- Credit Card number

Protecting PII is essential for personal privacy, data privacy, data protection, information privacy, and information security. With just a few bits of an individual's personal information, thieves can create false accounts in the person's name, incur debt, create a falsified passport or sell a person's identity to a criminal.

Transformer models are changing the world of machine learning, starting with natural language processing (NLP), and now, with audio and computer vision. Hugging Faceâ€™s mission is to democratize good machine learning and give anyone the opportunity to use these new state-of-the-art machine learning models.

Models Like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT-2 captured the NLP space and are achieving state-of-the-art results across almost any NLP tasks including, text-classification, question-answering, and token-classification.
